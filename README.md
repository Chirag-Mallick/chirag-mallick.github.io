# hacked-jekyll

Hacked Jekyll is a responsive, minimalistic Jekyll theme for a tiny personal website. It consists of a homepage and a 404 page. The homepage lists information about the user in a format that resembles JSON, giving the website a "hacked" appearance. As in JSON, elements can be strings, arrays, or hashes. One of the string elements, typically the user's description, can use [typed.js](https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/) to cycle through multiple lines of text.

The style is rebooted through [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and based on the [Open Color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) library. The monospaced typeface [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) is served together with the website. The favicons are generated by [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/).

See the [demo](https://piazzai.github.io/hacked-jekyll) to check the end result.
